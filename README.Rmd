How to reference a child document, within the parent .Rmd

## to a child .Rmd

1. Child document should have a standard code-chunk, legal code within
1. Parent code-chunk will reference child in the parent's code-chunk header

    - `{r child='src/example_child-document.Rmd'}`
    
**Advantage**: more than one code-chunk can call the same child sub-routine
    
    
## to child .R

1. Child document will not have R Markdown code chunks
1. Separate each sub-routine with a comment, followed by appropriate code.  For example:

```
# @kintr chunk_name
plot(cars)
```


3. Parent code-chunk will reference child sub-routine via sub-routine name

> `{r chunk_name}`

**Advantage**:  multiple sub-routines can be stored in a single .R file.
